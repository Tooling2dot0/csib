# GitFlow Workflow



### The branching strategy and release management.

The main branches are:
* Feature branches
* Release branches 
* Hotfixes branches


#### Features branches
*Devops will create a feature branch to develop their new feature. 
*Co-workers can work in paralell on the same features. 

#### Release branches
These branches are there to prepare the production release. Only small change are allowed.

#### HotFixes

These branches are only to fix a bug from the productions.
