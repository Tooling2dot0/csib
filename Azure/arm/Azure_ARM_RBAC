A common ask when working with Azure is “how do I protect my critical resources?” Often this ask is related to protecting those resources from a human doing something they shouldn’t be doing.  There are a few ways to apply varying levels of control to Azure resources: role-based access control (RBAC) and resource locks. 

 

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Using role-based access control, it is possible to restrict control-plane access to various Azure resources. 
Roles can be assigned at the subscription, resource group, and individual resource scope. A role is associated with specific rights (one or more “action” and “not action” values). 
There are currently 23 built-in roles.

Leveraging RBAC is a great way to help protect resources in Azure. With the Reader and various Contributor roles (e.g. Virtual Machine Contributor, Storage Account Contributor, 
SQL DB Contributor, etc.), you can effectively limit the actions that a user can take against a resource. However, even with one of the Contributor roles, it 
is still possible to delete
 specific resources. This makes it very easy to accidently delete an item . . . often an item that is not so easy to get back, like an Azure storage account. 
Oops! Resource locks provide a way to prevent the deletion of resources.



Role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure Portal and Azure Resource Manager API allows you to manage access to your subscription and resources at a fine-grained level. 
With this feature, you can grant access for Active Directory users, groups, or service principals by assigning some roles to them at a 
particular scope.


[root@clientpuppet07 deployment]# azure account list
info:    Executing command account list
data:    Name                      Id                                    Tenandt Id                            Current
data:    ------------------------  ------------------------------------  ------------------------------------  -------
data:    CA-Canada TBC-GIS Canada  c93a74b7-f399-405c-a8ae-6dc259fe7430  cc28a5e8-0488-431c-8bb8-be58ab7d8b97  true
info:    account list command OK



Check existing role assignments
Now let's check what role assignments exist in the subscription already. Type:

# azure role assignment list

==> To create a role assignment, you need to think about:

* Who you want to assign the role to: you can use the following Azure Active Directory cmdlets to see what users, groups and service principals you have in your directory.

# azure ad user list 
# azure ad user show 
# azure ad group list 
# azure ad group show 
# azure ad group member list 
# azure ad sp list 
# azure ad sp show

* What role you want to assign: you can use the following cmdlet to see the supported role definitions.

# azure role list


* What scope you want to assign: you have three levels for scopes:

- The current subscription
- A resource group. To get a list of resource groups, type azure group list
- A resource. To get a list of resources, type azure resource list

==> Then use azure role assignment create to create a role assignment. For example:

= This will create a role assignment at the current subscription level for a user as a reader:
# azure role assignment create --upn <user's email> -o Reader

= This will create a role assignment at a resource group level:
PS C:\> azure role assignment create --upn <user's email> -o Contributor -g group1 

= This will create a role assignment at a resource level:
# azure role assignment create --upn <user's email> -o Owner -g group1 -r Microsoft.Web/sites -u site1


##Verify permissions
After you check that your account has some role assignments, you can actually see the permissions these role assignments grant you by running:


# azure group list
# azure resource list


You can also check existing role assignments for a particular role definition, at a particular scope for a particular user. Type:
# azure role assignment list -g group1 --upn <user email> -o Owner
